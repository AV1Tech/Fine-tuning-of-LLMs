# Model Fine-Tuning with PeFT and LoRA
 
## Overview

This repository demonstrates the application of Parameter-efficient Fine-Tuning (PeFT) and Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) techniques for model fine-tuning. PeFT and LoRA are advanced methods that allow efficient and effective fine-tuning of large-scale models by adjusting only a subset of the model parameters.

## Features

- **Parameter-efficient Fine-Tuning (PeFT)**: Fine-tune large models with a minimal number of trainable parameters.
- **Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA)**: Implement low-rank updates to the model weights to achieve efficient training.
- **Scalable and Efficient**: Suitable for large-scale models and datasets.
- **Extensible**: Easily extendable to different models and tasks.
